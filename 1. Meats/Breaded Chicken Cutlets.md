Breaded Chicken Cutlets
=======================

Breaded chicken cutlets, or katsu as I so often refer to it in casual company, are one of the highest tasty-to-effort
chicken preparations I've found. Back when I was in college, the goto cheap preparation of chicken was usually baked
or pan fried - but at the low cost of some breading materials and some oil, you can transform that same cheap
chicken breast into a savory, fatty treat, which also has uses as a component in numerous other dishes, which
really takes the edge of preparing it in bulk.


Ingredients
-----------
* 1 lb. Chicken Breats or Cutlets
* 2 cups-ish Vegetable Oil
* 1.5 cups-ish Panko breadcrumbs
* 1/3rd cup flour
* 2-3 eggs
* pinch of salt
* pepper to taste

Kitchen Hardware
----------------
* 3 bowls for dredging
* Two plates or racks - one for raw meat, one for finished product
* Pan with vertical sides for frying in
* Mesh spoon and/or
* Tongs
* Oil splash guard (optional, but frying can be messy)
* Tenderizing hammer
* Plastic ziplock bag

Directions
----------
Actually frying the cutlet is a really fast process - no more than 2 minutes a cutlet. The real time sink is in preparation.

1. Clean and optionally cut the chicken breasts or cutlets - if using brests, splitting them in two down their natural "seam"
is usually a good split if you don't mind imbalanced halves. Naturally, if you don't cut the breats up, you'll have larger cutlets
- in some restauraunts, like Hurry Curry, the large cutlet is the style. Personally, I like my cutlets to be in units more
easily divisible.

2. One at a time, take each cutlet, place it into the plastic bag, seal it, place the bag against a surface safe to hammer on (eg,
a cutting board), and flatten the cutlet using a tenderizing hammer. Once flattened, remove the cutlet from the bag and move on to
the next. If you skip this step, you'll have thicker cutlets that take longer to cook through, which can result in less evenly
looked cutlets or in extreme cases an almost burnt exterior.

3. Serious Eats[1](#Resources) reccomends salting your chicken and letting it rest briefly to break down the proteins in the chicken.
(Or doing a full wet brine). If so inclined, after flattening is when I would do so, however after testing I usually skip it. Why?
Serious Eats reccomends salting to prevent the meat from drying out, since chicken is very lean. _However_, in salting the chicken,
you'll end up pulling a lot of moisture out of the chicken to begin with, and on top of that, you'll be adding quite a bit of salt
to the cutlet. Plus - the different texture you get from a salted cutlet I personally find less desirable - it's denser and got less
of a fluffy feel to it - likely because there's no steam ripping through the meat, airating it. On top of that, you lose your best timer
for frying - the activity of the oil on the water content of the cutlet. When salted, you're guaranteed an even fry with much less mess,
but your only indicator of doneness will be the browning level of the breading, which will be quite a range. When unsalted, the oil
will sputter as the water is drawn out of the meat - so long as the oil's still sputtering, the meat's not dry yet.

4. Prepare the dredging bowls for your cutlets - arrange them nearby your frying pan. Closest to the frying pan, put the breadcrumbs.
In the bowl next to that, crack the eggs and whisk to a relatively smooth texture. Depending on how generous you are with application
of the egg wash, 2 eggs might be enough, but 3 will always be enough. In the last bowl, put the flour, salt, and pepper and mix is a bit.
Not much flour is needed to dredge the chicken.

5. Heat up the oil in your frying pan. I have _always_ struggled with knowing when oil was hot enough to cook with. In college I used a
digital probe thermometer to measure oil temperature (very against the thermometer's directions, but it seemed to work), since if I didn't
I'd often exceed the oil's smoke point and trigger the fire alarm. Oops. Nowadays I just check general hotness with a few methods -
the simplest bar is just putting a single droplet of water onto the oil. Once it sputters, the oil is finally started to heat up. When I'm
using panko, I can then get a better indicator for when the oil is hot just by tossing in a breadcrumb - if it goes to a deep golden brown
in about 30 seconds or less, the oil's plenty hot. Usually I'll keep the oil on 60% of maximum burner output while cooking, though, again,
with a digital readout available, obsessively adjusting the burner to keep the oil at exactly a margin below it's smoke point is a good way
to ensure you cook things fully and quickly.

6. Now the cooking begins. Take a cutlet and dredge it in the flower - a lightcoating over the entire surface area, tapping off any excess.
Then coat it in egg with a quick dump in the wash, and using your other hand, remove it from the egg wash and drop it into the breadcrumbs.
Flip it over, coat the surface evenly with crumbs, then gently drop it into the oil in the pan. If the oil is hot enough, you can
easily fry multiple cutlets simultaneously in a large pan. Depdning on who you ask, the cutlet needs between 40 seconds and two minutes
to cook. The bar is, ofc, the internal tempterature of the meat, but you're not going to be measuring that, what with the hot oil.
Instead, you'll be guessing based on some proxies - once the breadcrumbs becomes golden, it means it's time to used the mesh spoon to flip
the cutlet. Give it another 30 or so seconds on the back (enough time for the other side to become golden brown) and then remove it from
the oil. As mentioned before, if you didn't salt your meat, the sputtering of the water in the meat converting into steam is also a
decent proxy - once it starts to slow, you should flip, give 10 or 20 seconds on the other side, and then remove. You can get a faster,
more even fry by using a spoon to ladle oil over the cutlet while it cooks (to approximate submerging it in a real deep fryer), however
the maybe 20-30 seconds this saves isn't usually worth it. However, if you're a stickler for the ligher golden brown color (and airier
breading) you could get from a deep fryer, it may be worth it to you.

Variations And Uses
-------------------
The recipe above is based mostly on the japanese-style katsu recipe, but the breaded chicken cutlet is universal. It makes prominent 
appearances in German and Italian cuisine as well. The biggest difference if you want to use your cutlet in, eg, your chicken parm sandwich,
is that you'll want to season the flour with more spices. As is, this is mostly a blank slate - you can add most any spices to it
since it's a neutral fatty breadiness as-is. For an italian-style cutlet, I'd contemplate mixing in some italian-ish-style spices like oregano,
basil, thyme, and/or rosemary. (Although mixing those into your sauce and keeping your cutlet neutral is valid!)

Once prepared the cutlet is a versatile meat. While tasty on it's own, or over rice, or under curry, it also goes well in a sandwich (either
with bulldog sauce, cabbage, and cheese as a kind of katsu sandwich, or with pasta sauce and parmesean as a chicken parm sandiwch).
It also slices up well to be used as a component in more exploratory burritos, as its neutral fattiness pairs well with most anything,
if you're feeling like mixing genres. I've, personally, made a cutlet, bacon, cheese, and egg, and bulldog sauce breakfast burrito in
the past and found it quite enjoyable - the extra crunch within the burrito gives it a much more satifying texture.
