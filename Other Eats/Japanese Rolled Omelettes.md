Japanese Rolled Omelettes
=========================

Or as my sister often calls them, "tamago" (which is just japanese for "eggs"). My younger sister actually taught me this one,
and honestly, I wish I could find the cute reminders she drew for me; but really - it's super simple, no reminder should be needed.

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp granulated sugar
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* seasame oil

Kitchen Hardware
----------------
* Bowl to beat egg in
* Fork to beat egg with
* Paper towel to grease pan with
* One small frying pan (square, if possible, for aesthetics)
* Chopsticks or flat thing to roll eggs with

Directions
----------

Crack the egg into a bowl and add the sugar and soy sauce. You can adjust the amounts of both to taste, but don't go overboard on the sugar, since
added sugar makes the egg burn faster. Beat the egg into a smooth consistency, and then keep going until it's airy. IMO, the airier the better.
Grease the pan by putting the paper towel over the top of a bottle of sesame oil and shaking the bottle to soak the towel, and the rubbing the greased
paper towel over the pan. Then heat it up to very hot, and pour on the egg. It will _rapidly_ cook, and your goal, nay, your job, is to use your
chopsticks to roll the omelette up right after the base firms up and before it burns (and the removing it from the pan onto a serving dish).
This is... _challenging_ for an infrequent chopstick user - I have cheated in the past by using the edge of a spatula or cake server to roll the omelette
up instead, however the challenge is part of the (rapid) preparation, IMO. The ideal omelette is soft, slightly runny inside the rolls, and firm on the outside,
with no browning or burning. Rolling at the right time is the first challenge, and thenr rolling quickly enough. The technique of removing
the pan from the heat when you begin rolling can help with extending your pre-burn window, if you can spare the hand. Some browning will
probably happen the first many times you prepare this - this is OK, it just looks bad (the browning will be the sugar). However, if you
find the underside of the egg blackened - be smarter than I during one of my first attempts - just crack a new egg and try again; burnt egg tastes bad.
