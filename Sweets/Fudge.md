Fudge
=====

Two years ago I did not know how to make fudge. This was a mistake. Fudge is simple, and makes a great gift, a great snack, a great desert,
and a great platform for experiemnting with flavors and textures (and tastes luxurious to boot). A basic fudge is only _3_ ingredients!
The only downside to fudge, in my mind, compared to its component chocolate, is that once dairy is introduced, so, too, is a shelf-life.
Fudge is best consumed within a few days after production, lest it dry out. Dry fudge is still technically edible (it won't spoil for
awhile longer after it dries out), just sad.

Ingredients
-----------
* 1lb chocolate (dealer's choice - milk, dark, semisweet, blend thereof - up to you)
* 1 can sweetended condensed milk
* 1-4oz butter, or cocoa butter, to taste

Kitchen Hardware
----------------
* Spatula, for stirring
* A double boiler - this can consist of
  * A pot
  * A metal bowl which fits comfortably over the pot without touching the liquid in the pot when 1/3rd full of water
* A mould to pour the fudge into to let it set - a small metal breadbin does this nicely.
* Plastic wrap to line the mould
* Coconut oil to grease the plastic wrap
  
Directions
----------
First, setup your mould for the result. I like a metal bread mould, as it produces a big block of fudge I can cut slices off of. The
mould _does_ need to be heat resistant, since you'll be pouring molten fudge into it. I like to spray the mould with coconut oil before
lining it with plastic wrap - this is all in the service of trying to make it easy to pull the set block of fudge out of the mould. If
you have a flexible silicone mould, neither the plastic wrap nor the oil are required, as you can likely just push the fudge out of the
mould.

Once that's ready to recieve, setup the double boiler and get it heating. That entails filling the pot about 1/3rd full with water, and placing the bowl on top.
The water within the pot shouldn't touch the bowl, and should be hoot, but not boiling or steaming - steam escaping from around the bowl
can actually damage the fudge, and the steam can cause the melting chocolate to sieze up, or so I'm told.

Once that's online, empty the can of condensed milk into the boiler and get it heating. You can then add in the chocolate and butter. Stir
slowly and gently - you should be able to feel the chocolate slowly lose structure and mix in to the milk, forming a smooth, regular fluid
that holds shape a bit when you remove the spatula. If it seems too liquidy after everything has dissolved, simply add more chocolate (or more cocoa
butter if using that). If it seems too thick, blend in a bit more condensed milk (or more normal butter, if using that).

Once thoroughly integrated, pour/scoop/scrape the molten fudge into the prepared mould. I like to then smooth the top with a spatula,
since oftentimes the top ends up becoming the bottom once freed from the mould, and I like my fudge to sit flat on a serving tray. If in
a mould with plastic wrap, I usually fold the plastic wrap over the top of the fudge to cover it. Place the mould in the fridge and let it
set - I usually wait overnight, but it's probably chilled much sooner.

Once set, removing the fudge from the mould can be a challenge (especially if the plastic wrap used on a metal mould broke). Slaming the
mould against, eg, a cutting board repeatedly to free the fudge is a valid tactic (as is running a knife along the edges of the mould). Slice or cube - serve however you please once extracted.

On cocoa butter v butter
------------------------
Cocoa butter results in a more chocolatey fudge, but the fudge also usually is harder (not chocolate-bar-hard, but harder). Cocoa butter is also notoriously expensive.
However, I keep some on hand (I buy in bulk), and I _do_ prefer it to butter for most fudges. I say most, because an especially dark
chocolate fudge probably needs dairy butter to still have a softer texture. The difference can be prominent between the two, especially
with non-chocolate-based chips. Caramel chips make a fudge that almsot doesn't have enough body to pick up in one piece without cocoa
butter to add more body. If you make enough fudge, you will find you have a prefered target texture (between thumbprint-soft and "hard" but still sliceable with a butter knife and teeth), and you will adjust the butter(s)
you add to reach that target texture.

Variations
----------
There are so many different ways to mix up fudge. Beyond changing the chips you use (milk, dark, semisweet, caramel, white, peanutbutter, mint),
you can also mix in and infuse toppings or fruits - like dried cherries, or chopped nuts. If mixing in a topping, around 1 cup should make a somewhat
chunky fudge. I'd stick to dried toppings - fresh fruits, for example, don't do too well when heated and locked into a semisolid block.
Although infused dried fruits - eg, dried cherries soaked in amaretto, I have found to be a resounding success. In addition to toppings,
layering or swirling multiple fudges into a single mould can also go very nicely (though this means you need to prepare multiple boilers
of fudge at once!). I've had good experiences with blending peanut butter and milk chocolate fudges together. White chocolate fudge is
also a decent blank canvas for flavor exploration - taking a white fudge and blending some blue food dye and some blueberry extract, for example,
can be very interesting (although be very careful with extracts - they're very strong).
