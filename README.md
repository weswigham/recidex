# recidex

A rolodex of recipes I've made (or in rare cases plan to make) alongside my own notes and expiences on each.

Why?

For a long time I thought I'd just be able to search the web to find the recipies I was looking for - and as long as I'm not looking for a _specific_ recipe, that's true. The issue lies in when I try to remember how I made a thing the last time I made it - either because I want to repeat the performance or iterate on it. So taking that, plus the inspiration by [my friend and his recipe repository](https://github.com/ibanner56/NotRubyButChef), I do think there's a space for aggregating the resources used as background for an article as a way of extended reading. Personally, when I make something _new_ I never read just _one_ recipe for it - instead I try to find a collection and identify what they diverge on and what tradeoffs were made. I don't often go so far as performing the experiments myself (though sometimes I do!), but this does give me perspective for the determining the exact composition of a recipe my own way. So, to that end, I am now endeavoring to collect the recipes for the things I've made - so I can have a reference guide to my own cooking.
